# My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in Rust

## How to run
All solutions take input on stdin. I suggest to use the brilliant [aocf tool](https://github.com/nuxeh/aocf). Follow their steps to set it up. Next, to run, for example day 1/2020, execute:
```sh
aocf checkout 1 2020 && aocf input | cargo run --bin day1
```
