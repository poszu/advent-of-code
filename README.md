# My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in Rust

## Year 2020 (wip)
It is a work in progress:
- completed (2 stars): days 1 - 3, 6 - 12,
- half-completed (1 star): days 4 and 5.

## Year 2021 (completed - 50 stars)

## How to run
The repo contains a Rust workspace with solutions placed in relevant directory (for example, `2021/day1`).

All solutions contain my input in `src/input.txt` file, which is compiled into the binary.

To run given day execute:
```
cargo run --bin <day>_<year>
```

For example:
```
cargo run --bin day1_2021
```

To run tests, execute:
```
cargo test --bin <day>_<year>
```
